I love Paris and dream of visiting it again while I paint it and enjoy it. I hope that my paintings reflect my feelings and will find a response in the hearts of the same romantics and lovers of Paris as me. The choice in the materials fell on pastels, because pastels can write and convey any nuances and create both realistic and emotional pictures. And also dry pastel is my favorite material in painting and drawing. I hope that my work will delight the happy owner of this picture, and possibly my other works. I paint and write with love!",
